# Audio-to-Text

Convert audio files into text using Python!

## Overview

**Audio-to-Text** is a simple Python project for converting audio files (such as WAV, MP3, etc.) into written text using popular speech recognition libraries. Itâ€™s ideal for transcription tasks, voice note conversion, or basic speech-to-text automation.

## Features

- Converts audio files to text
- Supports common audio formats (WAV, MP3, etc.)
- Uses Python and open-source speech recognition libraries
- Easy to run and extend

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [speech_recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [pydub](https://pypi.org/project/pydub/) *(for MP3 support)*
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) *(if handling non-WAV formats)*

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pydub
```
For MP3 support, ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and available in your system path.

## Usage

1. Place your audio file in the project directory.
2. Run the main script (e.g., `main.py`):

```bash
python main.py input_audio.wav
```

3. The transcribed text will be output to the console or saved to a file, depending on implementation.

## Example

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
audio_file = 'input_audio.wav'

with sr.AudioFile(audio_file) as source:
    audio_data = recognizer.record(source)
    text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
    print(text)
```

## Customization

- Change the recognizer to use other APIs (Google, Sphinx, etc.)
- Extend for batch processing or longer audio files
- Save output to a text file
